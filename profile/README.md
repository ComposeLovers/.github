## Hello everyone,

As a group of young developers, we are creating projects using the Kotlin language. We always use the latest technologies. If you see anything you don't like or think could be improved, don't hesitate to open a PR :) If you'd like to support us and enjoy learning on this journey, you can reach us at:
